# Python Scripting – Complete Class Notes (Introductory Session)

## 1. Class Introduction
This session is an introductory lecture on Python scripting aimed at DevOps engineers, cloud engineers, developers, and beginners. Classes are recorded, notes are shared via LMS, and no prior programming knowledge is required.

## 2. Why Learn Python?
Python is interpreter-dependent, easy to learn, and widely used in industry for scripting, automation, testing, DevOps, and cloud deployments.

## 3. What is Scripting?
Scripting involves writing small programs or snippets to test applications, validate deployments, and automate tasks.

## 4. Compiler vs Interpreter
Both translate source code into machine code.

### Compiler
- Translates entire program at once
- Shows all errors together
- Example: C

### Interpreter
- Translates line by line
- Stops at first error
- Example: Python

## 5. Why Interpreter Languages for Testing
